# Privilege Walk

An interactive version of the [What is Privilege](http://www.buzzfeed.com/dayshavedewi/what-is-privilege) article and video from Buzzfeed.

I am not the creator of the questions, I just wanted to make the questions more interactive so you can invision yourself doing the walk without actually having to get up.

You can try it out for yourself at [privilege-walk.meteor.com](http://privilege-walk.meteor.com/)

Built in Meteor.js.
